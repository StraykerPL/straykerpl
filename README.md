### My Workflow:

All projects on my profile are training/R&D projects. Professional projects are stored in [Strayker Software](https://github.com/Strayker-Software) organisation.
Workflow on my profile's projects isn't consistent and isn't following organisation's workflow, so be prepared to see different boards structures, different ReadMe templates etc.
